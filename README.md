# OAK

## Thanks
- Big thanks to uniswap wallet repo and all the hardworking contributors of my favorite project in web3
- https://github.com/Uniswap/wallet
- I spent more than a few hours in their `package.json` figuring out which integrations to use and saving a lot of lead time on implementation details

- Also thanks to GPT-4 for supercharging my dev lifecycle; some of the more mundane/trivial tasks for utility functions, repo layout, set up, and and menial tasks that still contribute a lot to cognitive load were offloaded to GPT. Probably saved me 10-20 hours of dev time.

## Getting Started
- install expo go on mobile app, install expo cli
- `npm install` - install those dependencies
- `npx expo start` - get the dev server running
- scan QR code on dev server with camera app/expo go

## Testing

Testing for iOS is such a pain... my goodness

### IOS only
- find your device UDID # (https://udid.tech/) (your mobile phone only please)
- send it to me, I'll register you (I only have 100 slots, non transferrable...) (Ill add you here: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/devices/add)
- great, you're now provisioned.
